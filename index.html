    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Raksh is a smart emergency alert system designed to provide immediate help during unsafe situations. 
    With a single click, users can send their live location to nearby app users and police authorities, 
    ensuring faster response and community-driven safety.</p>
</section>

<section id="problem">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In emergency situations, victims often fail to receive immediate assistance due to lack of awareness 
    among nearby people. There is a need for a system that can instantly notify nearby individuals and 
    authorities with live location details.</p>
</section>

<section id="proposed">
    <h2>Proposed System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One-click Emergency Alert</li>
        <li>Live Location Sharing</li>
        <li>Notification to Nearby Users</li>
        <li>Police Integration</li>
        <li>Community-Based Safety Network</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="architecture">
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>User → Mobile App → Location Capture → Server → Nearby Users + Police Notification</p>
</section>

<section id="methodology">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>User registers and enables location.</li>
        <li>In emergency, user presses SOS button.</li>
        <li>Location is captured using GPS.</li>
        <li>Alert sent to nearby users within defined radius.</li>
        <li>Police authority receives alert notification.</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section id="results">
    <h2>Results (Prototype Stage)</h2>
    <p>A basic web prototype has been developed to demonstrate emergency alert flow and 
    structured system design. Future implementation will include real-time backend integration.</p>
</section>

<section id="future">
    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time backend implementation</li>
        <li>Integration with government emergency services</li>
        <li>AI-based danger prediction</li>
        <li>Wearable emergency trigger device</li>
